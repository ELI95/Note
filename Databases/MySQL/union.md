- difference
  - union
      - Sort and deduplicate  
  - union all
      - Return the merged result directly, without sorting or deduplication
- insight
  - The implication of this, is that union is much less performant as it must scan the result for duplicates 
  - UNION ALL can be slower than UNION in real-world cases where the network such as the internet, is a bottleneck. The cost of transferring many duplicate rows can exceed the query execution time benefit. This has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis
